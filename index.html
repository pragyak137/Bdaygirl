							<p>First of all before I say something I wish you a very Happy Birthday!!, Sunidhi...🥳🥳🥳🥳 Okay here goes my boring speech😅🤣:
							 I still remember, my KV days were one of my most beautifull time of my life with you guys, although I was the nerd, unpopular type of guy in class and was kinda shy talking to girls...😅😅🤣.  
							To be honest , before 10 th i think the only time that we talked is when you  told me to bring articles for the bulletin board ...😅🤣 
							I remember playing that ball game (pitthu i guess🙄) with u guys and that was really fun. After that I went to hostel😑... I regret doing that 😑😑😑😑 ... 
							 Well to be honest You really are cute, good and smart. (Haa... Manle 100% sach h ye 😊🖤).</p>
							<p>I remember you in tuition at Yadav's. You used to come with Pragya and Shivangi and your spot was always fixed i.e, at left side of the board.  Also a big thankx to Balaji, the moment i was with him i knew that i will atleast get to talk to you 😅😏😂. 
							You were the most innocent girl among all the girls, You were always quiet and studious from what i remember in KV😊😊. 
							I never saw you got punished or your name on the black board written by the class monitor.😶 
							I used to observe you (or you can say staring😅😝😂)... 
							I am really lucky to have a friend like you. 
							Again a very very Happy birthday 🎉🎉🎉🎂..... Have a blast ... Aur party karo jamke yehi to time h bc party karne ka 🥳🥳🥳..(warning: Party inside and wear mask for safety purpose 😅😂🤣🤣🤣 and also Alcohol is injurious to health but not when you are having it with friends 😝🤣)
							Im very happy that we all KVians are still in touch and really hope for a reunion..🥺😊.

							<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 22px;">Today is your day so I won't yell at you...A very Happy Birthday. It means a lot to me how you have grown so much these past years as a woman. But still you are irritating as always...but whatever you are however you are..I guess you got stuck with me as your sister..But remember I'll always be there for you whenever you need me..that's the wholesome purpose of being siblings.<br>   
							You just can't get rid of me ever. I just want you to grow as beautiful person inside and out. Be truthful to yourself and have some self confidence. I want to see you as a strong independent person in these coming years.<br>
							Remember you can be anything you wanna be ( except younger).</p>

							<p style="font-size: 17px;">Today is the day you were born, We all people had imagined you, the baby you with those cute lil spects (gifted by god). Ek ke sath ek free wala thing. I hope you remember that conversation of ours. Friendship is one of the best relationships a person could have in his life and You are the one for me!!! There is this saying ”Appearances are Deceptive” jo dikhta hai waisa jaruri nahi hai ki ho hi!! You are one of the example . People may have misconception about you. But people who are close to you ,know what an amazing person you are. You are the funniest person I have ever met in my life!!!! You have an awesome sense of humour. Everyone is lucky to have you! I still can’t believe I am lucky enough to meet someone as weird as you!! We’re so hilarious together that I feel bad for the people who don’t get to listen our conversations.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 22px;">I just want to say don’t change yourself for anybody .Stay the same !!You are super good my friend bas aise hi reh. Khush reh. Depression me jane ka kaam mera rehta hai hamesha se tu mat ho jana… nahi toh who will console me??hmm?…Mere therapist ka kharcha bach jata hai just because of you!!<br>
							You know what ..The beautiful friendship we share makes me so so happy!! I can’t even express in words when I am with you I can be honest and lay my heart bare. 
							It doesn’t matter where life takes us, our friendship and all the special moments that we share will stay forever in my heart!! Thanks for being you and being mine.
							Happy birthday to you. <br><br>
							I WISH YOU ALL THE SUCCESS AND LOVE.<br>
							Reminder : You are loved beyond measure!<br><br>
							“ANOTHER BIRTHDAY DOWN,<br>
							 A HUNDRED MORE TO GO ….WITH ME!!!<br>
